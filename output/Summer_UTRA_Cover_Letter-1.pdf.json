This internship presents a unique opportunity to explore these interests further. I’ll investigate this phenomenon at its root: as children don’t have much information about the world, I’ll discover firsthand how they acquire and process information, while guiding them and their development to become better people. Finally, I strongly believe in the importance of communication for human happiness and function. Investigating language and cognition through this project will provide invaluable insights into the mechanisms of human communication, something beneficial not only for my own life, but for the life of every human being.",
